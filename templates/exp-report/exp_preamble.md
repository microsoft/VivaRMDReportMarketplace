**Why is Employee Experience important?** 

A positive employee experience is strongly related to company outcomes, predictive of lower turnover and foundational to a strong company culture. Research has shown that companies in the top 25% on employee experience report 3x the return on assets and there was lower turnover within teams that were scoring in the top 25% on employee experience within the company. A positive employee experience can be broken down into 6 core pillars: 

1. **Wellbeing**: You feel uniquely valued, your personal time is respected and are treated with dignity.
2. **Empowerment**: You are empowered to make decisions about how to best direct your talent and effort with the support of your manager.
3. **Connection**: You belong as a trusted, integral member of a diverse community. You have high-quality relationships with your colleagues.
4. **Growth**: You get what you need to maximize your strengths, learn new skills and broaden your exposure.
5. **Focus**: You know what success looks like, what to prioritize and the time to work towards those goals.
6. And finally **purpose**: Your work serves a bigger role and you are able to have meaningful impact. You can control your diaries and foster close relationships.
